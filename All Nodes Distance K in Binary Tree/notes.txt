Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node target, and an integer k, return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance k from the target node.

You can return the answer in any order.

Solution:
Populate Parent Pointer for each node and then use Level order Traveral Stop at level==k
hashtable can be used to store parent pointer

Two Method for populating parent pointer
1.Use DFS Metod
2. Use Level order Traversal

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(N)
