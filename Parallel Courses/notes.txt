Problem Statement:
You are given an integer N which denotes the number of courses numbered from 1 to N and a matrix  ‘prerequisites’, in which each row contains exactly two integers ‘A’ and ‘B’ which represents the course ‘A’ has to be studied in some semester before studying course ‘B’.
You are supposed to find the minimum number of semesters required to study all the courses.

Solution:
Since we need to find order in which courses need to completed so we use topological ordering as there 
is prerequisite to each course. if topological ordering is not possible we cannot complete course and hence 
cannot find minimum number of semester so we return -1 else to find minimum number of semesters all those
courses that can completed independently must be scheduled in the same semester that is increase count by 1
and each time in a level if we got some independent courses all those can be scheduled in the same semester
(increase count by 1).

TC -> O(V+E)
SC -> O(V+E)
