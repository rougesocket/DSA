Problem Link: 
Given the root of a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree with the same node values. If there is more than one answer, return any of them.

A binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

Solution:
The idea to use over here is the inorder traversal of binary tree is always sorted and once we have inorder
traversal ready we can create a height balance tree by always partitioning the array from middle.
time complexity is linear for finding inorder traversal and linear to build the tree since we visit
all the nodes and it requires O(1) time to perform build operation O(N*1) = O(N)

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(N)
