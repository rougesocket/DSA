Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

Solution: 
The idea here is to use either DFS or BFS traversal.

DFS Traversal:
when you reach a level for first time and its node is not included in your ans you include it.
Note:
Recurse for right first since we want right view

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(N)

BFS Traversal:
you process node level wise from RIGHT TO LEFT and the first node encounterd in the process is pushed into your
answer
Note:
Push Right node first in the queue since we want right view

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(N)
