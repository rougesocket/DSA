Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Solution:
calculate the height for each node and the diameter for current node is nothing but sum of left height and 
right height for that node inorder to find max diameter we need to return the one which gives max benifit from
left or right +1 for current node and return it to its parent. since path is continous and does not include 
repeated nodes.

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(N)
