Problem Statement:
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Solution:
the idea here is when we encounter the node that matches with p or q we return the value the of that node. a
non null value is propogated to top and if both of the path give non null value means that is LCA

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(N)
