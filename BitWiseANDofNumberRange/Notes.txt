Problem Statement:
Given two integers left and right that represent the range [left, right], return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

Solution:
the idea we use over here is that once we have a range no matter how many times we encounter
a set bit at a particular position even if we encounter a single unset(0) bit then
its contribution will be zero in the answer
eg : [5,7] 

5 -> 101
6 -> 110
7 -> 111

5&6&7 = 100
though we have two set bit at position two from right but a single 0 bit made our answer
as zero at that position

so we need to find only the common part that is not changing since it is the part that will remain intact and will be pass as
it as we go on computing Bitwise AND in that range
another thing is that the part which is changing will always be zero and its count is 
important since we need to shift our ans by that many position as their contribution
will be zero at the end of computation

so the overall question boils down to find the common part of numbers we do not need 
to go over all numbers in range to find common part we can find common part between left and right
because left act as lower threshold meaning no change in bits below that or it is like base.
if some common part exist as per the above observation we will find it if everything is
changing then ans is zero

TC -> O(logn)
SC -> O(1)
