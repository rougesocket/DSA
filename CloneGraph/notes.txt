Problem Statement:
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

Solution:

the idea here is to use any graph exploration algorithm and create copy of the curr node and hash it
so that later we can adjust connections between them once all required node are created.

TC -> O(V+E) for dfs
SC -> O(V) for hashmap
