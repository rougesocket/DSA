Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

Solution:
Use Level order traversal with a direction variable to indicate Left to right or right to left direction.

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(N)
