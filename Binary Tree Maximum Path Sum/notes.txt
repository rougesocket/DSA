Problem Statement:
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

Solution:
The idea here is to find sum for left and right path from each node and take max out of them.
Note: in case of negative path sum just return 0 because they will make your answer move away from optimality.

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(N)
