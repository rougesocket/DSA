Problem Statement:
Given four integer arrays nums1, nums2, nums3, and nums4 all of length n, return the number of tuples (i, j, k, l) such that:

    0 <= i, j, k, l < n
    nums1[i] + nums2[j] + nums3[k] + nums4[l] == 0

Solution:
The idea here is to store pair wise sum in a hashmap and find the corresponding negative pair in the other two and
then add the cnt of it to the ans


TC -> O(N^2)
SC -> O(N^2) reason as there are N^2 pairs that are stored in map
