Problem Statement:
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Solution: 
Since XOR is self inverse we just need to find xor of all the elements which will cancel
the duplicates present in the array leaving us with the only number which appear one time.

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(1)
