Problem Statement:
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Solution:
Just find xor and count number of set bits similar to counting bits problem

TC -> O(logn)
SC -> O(1)
