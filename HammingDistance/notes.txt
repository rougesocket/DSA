Problem Statement:
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Solution: 
Just find the xor of two number and then count number of set bits using the same logic in counting bits

TC -> O(logn)
SC -> O(1)
