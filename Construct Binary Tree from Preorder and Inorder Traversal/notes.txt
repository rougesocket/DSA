Problem Statement:
Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

Solution:
since we are provided with inorder and preorder so we can construct a unique tree. we have preorder so we know
about root node we find root from preorder we have to find root's position inorder so that we can split 
the node in left subtree and right subtree we recusively break the tree and when we are not able to do that
we return from that point and whatever it returns from sub tree we assign it accordingly to left and right half
and we return parent back.

TC -> O(N)
SC -> O(N)
